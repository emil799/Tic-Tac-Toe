## Description

This is a **Tic Tac Toe** game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Kotlin, allowing you to play against another player or a bot. It offers features like name input for players and score tracking. You can choose between two game modes:
- **Player vs Player (PvP)**: Play against another human.
- **Player vs Bot**: Play against a basic AI bot.

### Features

- **Name Input**: Enter custom names for both players in PvP mode or your name when playing against the bot. These names will be displayed during the game and in the score.
- **Player Selection**: Choose to play as 'X' or 'O' when playing against the bot.
- **Score Display**: The game keeps track of the scores of each player and displays the names and the results after each game.
- **Play Modes**: You can play either against another player or the bot.
  
## How to Play

1. **Select Game Mode**: Choose whether to play against another player or the bot by clicking the corresponding button on the main menu.
